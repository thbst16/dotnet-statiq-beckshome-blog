# dotnet-statiq-beckshome-blog

The dotnet-statiq-beckshome-blog solution is the fourth version of my blog's hosting engine. I have moved from the original Das Blog to Wordpress (hosted and then static) to a .NET-based static site generator (Statiq). As part of this port, all of my content was converted to relatively standard markdown format and I kept the external S3 blob storage for images. This standardization of content input will enable me to relatively easily import my blog content to other markdown-based static site generators in the future, if required.
