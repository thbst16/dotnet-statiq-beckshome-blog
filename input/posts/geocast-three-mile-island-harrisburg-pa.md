Three Mile Island, the nuclear power plant which, at least figuratively speaking, is located right in my back yard, was the site of the nation’s worst nuclear disaster in March of 1979. What better site to select for my first custom Geocast then something so near and dear to the locals’ hearts.

Sure, the recording quality is not great but it just further proves that it doesn’t take too much to create a Geocast, convert it to an MP3, and upload it for consumption. I’ve included a link to the file below but you can, of course, also find this under the Pennsylvania category on GeoGlue.com.

Drop me a line and let me know what you think and, if you’re ever in the neighborhood, make sure to include this tourist attraction on your itinerary.
