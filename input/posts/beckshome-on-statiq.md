After 7 years of being dormant, the beckshome.com blog hummed back to life over the past month. What started with [a full .NET hosted blog](/2006/06/das-blog-installation), [moved to Wordpress](/2011/09/web-hosting-provider-cutover) and then was exported from Wordpress to create static content in 2015, which is where things stood for the past 7 years.  

* Port to statiq - backreference to Das Blog
* On github, other great links on how to do it right...
* Some lessons learned
    * _directory.yml for URLs
    * web.confi for hosting on Azure App Services / IIS
    * google analytics from _head.cshtml
    * enlighterer in _layout.cshtml
    * _post-footer.cshtml for giscus
    * _sidebar.cshmlt and _social_links.cshtml for social links (could do other like Twitter)
