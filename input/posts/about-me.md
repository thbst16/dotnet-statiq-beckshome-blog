I’ve been blogging for 4 years now and never have filled out the “About Me” section on my blog. I’ve had good intentions for a while but just never got around to it because my vision involved scanning in a bunch of older materials. I’ve finally carved out a bit of time to update the default blurb with suitable material, which [you can find here](https://blog.beckshome.com/about). Unless you’ve known me for a long while, you’re sure to find out an interesting new thing or two. Give it a look!
