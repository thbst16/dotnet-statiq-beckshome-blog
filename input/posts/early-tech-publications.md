In porting my blog to Statiq, I was forced to revisit a whole lot of content, most of which is more than a decade old. As part of this review, I cleaned up old broken links, of which there were many. I would estimate that 60% of the web links I had from my original blog pages were to sites or content that no longer existed. This says a lot about how the web has evolved and how much content turns over as time progresses. 

While I removed external links that no longer existed, there were some links to content from early publications I had authored for Dr.Dobb's Journal and the Java Developers Journal. I had hesitated posting the original articles since they were historically avaialble online. It looks like somewhere between 2015 and 2022, these sites ceased to exist. I decided to publish the full original articles online since this is the only way they remain avaialble.
