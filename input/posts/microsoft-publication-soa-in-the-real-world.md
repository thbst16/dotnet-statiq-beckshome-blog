[Tad Anderson posted](https://realworldsa.blogspot.com/2007/07/service-oriented-architecture-soa-in.html) about the release of an SOA-related e-book from Microsoft concerning Service Oriented Architecture (SOA). This is one area in which Microsoft has remained notably quiet compared with competing enterprise software vendors such as IBM and Sun. As Tad points out in his post, Microsoft has made some forays into SOA publications and they have been pretty readable.

Their most recent publication, SOA in the Real World ([mirrored here](https://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.beckshome.com/20070727-SOA-In-The-Real-World.pdf)), is one of the better pieces of SOA writing that I’ve encountered, vendor-specific or otherwise. It uses Microsoft technologies to illustrate certain principles but it manages to maintain a largely implementation-agnostic viewpoint. The e-book has multiple authors but it was edited together in a very seamless way, which is not always the easiest thing to pull off.

The e-book appears to have been pulled together by Microsoft’s Architectural Resource Center (ARC). No authors are listed specifically and the ARC branding is new, somewhat resembling the branding used for Microsoft’s Architecture Journal. The publication includes a pretty sound enterprise SOA approach, detailed explanations of how some of the major pieces of a SOA come together and a description of how Microsoft’s technologies fit in the mix. Whether one architect’s opinion or the Microsoft party line, there are some insightful and succinct explanations provided, such as the differences between Workflow Foundation and BizTalk when it comes to implementing workflow.

This book is a great read for anyone looking for a solid introduction to SOA and could well be the definitive read for anyone dealing with SOA and Microsoft technologies.
