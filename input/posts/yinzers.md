If you haven’t spent any time in Pittsburgh, you can ignore this post. If you have spent some portion of your life there or know someone who has, have I got a great gift idea for you. “Chipped Ham Sam”, the first in a line of Yappin ‘Yinzers dolls is available for purchase at http://www.yappinyinzers.com. Check out the site and poke Sam in the belly for one of 9 witty Pittsburghese sayings.

This is a great gift idea for native Pittsburghers, CMU / Pitt students, or anyone in the Steeler nation who has had a chance to experience the flavor of the steel city. This product is the brainchild of a former colleague. Goes to show what 6 years of systems integration work can do to a person.
