The BSCoE4J Java application development framework was released today to the Commonwealth and is now available for download. The framework contains both abstract and concrete components that support the creation, manipulation, and persistence of domain objects. It interfaces well with, and is meant by no means to supplant, well-understood open source frameworks that address presentation layer, persistence layer, or domain object creation and discovery challenges.

The addition of the BSCoE4J Framework as the third core BSCoE assets rounds off the BSCoE offering for custom enterprise application development. BSCoE4J joins the BSCoE.NET Framework and the BSCoE Software Engineering Process (SEP), forming a comprehensive set of tools for Commonwealth applications looking to do development in either Java or .NET.
