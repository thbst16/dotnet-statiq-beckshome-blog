It’s been a while since I’ve posted my last entry. To get myself back in the groove of things, I thought that it might be nice to post something lighthearted and entertaining that your average tech weenie would enjoy. Now I don’t know if you follow the gurus of the technology world but my research has turned up a set of long lost brothers amongst the talking (or blogging) heads. Check out the two pictures below. The one on the left is [Bruce Schneier](https://www.schneier.com/), cryptography and computer security wunderkind and designer of several cryptographic algorithms, including Blowfish and Twofish. The one on the right is [Martin Fowler](https://www.martinfowler.com/), refactoring, pattern, and agile god.

I couldn’t believe it myself when I first saw this but a side-by-side of these two gentlemen makes things perfectly clear. There’s got to be some common lineage here. It’s crazy to think about what our world might have been blessed with were these two great minds not separated at birth. Agile cryptography? Algorithmic refactoring?
