With two little girls running around the house, I have plenty of material to fuel my zeal to experiment with online audio and video. I uploaded a cut of Anna using her own utensils for the first time.

Aside from the family and sentimental value, I learned a couple of things for a first timer:

* Use firewire and not USB for video transfer. This makes all the difference in the world.
* Don’t use the WMV format. I uploaded WMV instead of AVI at the recommended screen size and after the conversion to Flash, there’s quite a bit of residual fuzz.
* YouTube is slow in the evening (8:00 – 11:00 EDT). Video playback drags quite a bit. This will impact willingness to leverage YouTube video content externally.
* There doesn’t appear to be the ability to download YouTube video. I believe this option is provided on Google Video. Once again, this impacts ability to integrate into other applications.

All-in-all, YouTube makes uploading and sharing video an easy process. I can’t say that I understand their revenue model but someone is paying the one million dollar network costs they ring up monthly with their content distribution network and, at least for now, it’s not me.
