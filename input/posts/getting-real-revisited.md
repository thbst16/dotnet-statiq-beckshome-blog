In a previous posting, I reviewed the 37signals book <i>Getting Real</i> and encouraged folks to pick up a copy. The good news is that the full text for this book has recently been released online. You can find the HTML version of the book [here](https://basecamp.com/books/getting-real). You no longer have any excuse not to read it.
