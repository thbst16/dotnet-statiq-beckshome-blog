The first, albeit very rudimentary, version of GeoGlue is now available online at www.geoglue.com. As described in previous posts, this release is really nothing more than a soundseeing mashup with Google maps. The functionality is very basic, allowing the user to browse for soundseeing tours graphically using maps and a menu system or to search for tours using a combination of keywords. All tours are provided via MP3 streaming audio, either from the site that created the tour or from GeoGlue.com directly.

We are planning a follow up release in the near future. This release will make the map-based transitions a bit smoother by using AJAX instead of pure postbacks. We will also be working on increasing the content base, allowing users to suggest new soundseeing torus and rolling out a user provisioning system. Keep your eyes open and, as always, email us at admin@geoglue.com if you have any questions or suggestions.
