On October 4, 2006, the Pennsylvania State Capitol Building celebrates the centennial anniversary of its dedication. In honor of this special event, I have created a GeoCast for the Capitol building, its art, and some surrounding points of interest. This GeoCast can be downloaded or streamed in MP3 format by clicking the link below or by going to the Pennsylvania category on GeoGlue.com.

If you are interested in further information about the Capitol or the centennial celebration activities, the Capitol Preservation Committee website provides a treasure trove of information. If you can’t make the trip to Harrisburg but would like to experience the Capitol’s beauty, a QuickTime virtual tour is available on line as well.
