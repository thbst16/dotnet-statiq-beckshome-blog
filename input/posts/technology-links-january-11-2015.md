Couple of exciting things to link to from last week:
* Docker – O’Reilly released an awesome [Introduction to Docker video](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/introduction-to-docker/9781491916179/). Total runtime is less than 2 hours. Definitely a recommended watch if you’re looking to get familiar with the Docker container. Free to those who have an O’Reilly Safari subscription.
* Azure VM Images – Microsoft announces a host of [Azure Virtual Machine Images for Visual Studio](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/azure-virtual-machine-images-for-visual-studio.aspx). A great way to get exposure to the other Visual Studio SKUs or run the newer versions of VS without having to deal with the headaches of an install.
* App Development – [Awesome article](https://medium.com/@carlosribas/how-hourstracker-earns-five-figures-a-month-on-the-app-store-85a20bb972eb) on how independent mobile app development works and can be quite lucrative.
* Feature Toggles – Good course from Pluralsight on [implementing feature toggles in .NET](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/dotnet-featuretoggle-implementing). Something architects should be aware but the process and patterns are not widely documented.
