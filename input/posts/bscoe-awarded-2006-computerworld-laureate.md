The BSCoE project recently received a Computerworld Honors Program laureate honoring the project for its use of information technology to benefit society. It looks like the official case studies and pictures of the award ceremonies have been posted online. You can find the BSCoE case study here. Iâ€™ve also included a couple of interesting photos from the Computerworld ceremonies including the snapshot of our client receiving the award.
